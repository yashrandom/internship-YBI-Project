🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to develop a predictive model that can assess whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic health data. Utilizing a dataset from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, the model applies various machine learning algorithms to deliver accurate and reliable predictions, aiding early diagnosis and potential intervention.

📌 Key Features
Preprocessing of medical data including missing value handling and feature scaling

Supervised learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors

Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualization of data distributions and model performance

Streamlit-based web app for user interaction (optional extension)

📂 Dataset
Source: Pima Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle

Attributes: Includes features like Glucose, BMI, Age, Blood Pressure, Insulin levels, etc.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

(Optional) Streamlit for frontend deployment

🎯 Goal
The main goal is to assist healthcare professionals or users in early identification of diabetes risks using data-driven insights.

📈 Results
Achieved up to X% accuracy (replace with actual score) with optimized model performance and validation metrics, showcasing reliable results for potential real-world application.
